# JOINS-PRACTICE

**COMPANY**: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: HEMAKSHI INGALE

**INTERN ID**: CT08KXN

**DOMAIN**: SQL

**BATCH DURATION**: JANUARY 10th TO FEBRUARY 10th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

This repository contains SQL scripts and outputs related to practicing different types of SQL joins, specifically INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN. The task aims to demonstrate the meaningful combination of data from two tables—Employees and Departments—using various join operations. The project uses Indian names and department locations for contextual relevance, making the data relatable and practical.

The SQL task was performed in MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client, and this repository includes all the necessary scripts to create the database, define the tables, insert sample data, and execute join operations. The purpose of this task is to enhance database management and querying skills, especially in the context of relational databases.

 **Features**
**Database Creation**: A new database, JoinPractice, was created to house the tables and operations for this task.
**Table Definitions**:
**Employees**: A table containing details of employees, including their ID, name, department ID, and salary.
**Departments**: A table containing department details, including department ID, name, and location.
**Join Operations**:
INNER JOIN: Combines rows with matching DeptID values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Includes all rows from the Employees table, even if no matching DeptID exists in the Departments table.
RIGHT JOIN: Includes all rows from the Departments table, even if no matching DeptID exists in the Employees table.
FULL JOIN: Combines all rows from both tables, filling in NULL for unmatched data. (Emulated using UNION in MySQL.)

**Platforms Used**
 MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client: The primary platform for executing the SQL scripts and observing outputs.
 GitHub: For version control and hosting the repository.

**Libraries/Technologies Used**
 SQL: Structured Query Language for database creation, manipulation, and querying.
 MySQL: Relational database management system used for executing SQL queries.

 This project showcases the importance of understanding join operations in relational databases. By working with real-world examples such as employee and department data, the task emphasizes the practical application of SQL in solving business problems. The usage of MySQL 8.0 ensures compatibility with modern database standards, providing a robust platform for performing complex queries and data manipulation. Moreover, the repository serves as a resource for learners and professionals aiming to strengthen their SQL skills, offering a step-by-step approach to mastering joins.

 To further extend this project, one could incorporate advanced SQL concepts such as indexing, stored procedures, and triggers to optimize queries and automate operations. Visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI could also be integrated to represent join outputs graphically, enhancing data interpretation. Future iterations of this project may include integration with programming languages like Python or Java to demonstrate the interaction between applications and databases, making the repository a comprehensive guide to SQL-based development workflows. This repository serves as a helpful resource for students, professionals, and enthusiasts looking to strengthen their SQL skills. Each script is designed to demonstrate a specific use of SQL joins, making the learning experience step-by-step and practical.

**Future Enhancements**
Incorporate advanced SQL features such as indexing, stored procedures, and triggers for optimizing queries and automating tasks.
Use visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to represent the results of join operations graphically, improving data interpretation.
Integrate with programming languages like Python or Java to demonstrate application-database interactions.
Expand the dataset for larger-scale join operations and include examples of nested and correlated subqueries for advanced learning.
